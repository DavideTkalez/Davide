I am a Biomedical Engineering student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Biomechanics at the Polytechnic University of Turin, with a solid background in 3D modeling, simulations, and data analysis. 
Technically driven and eager to learn, I have developed strong interdisciplinary skills, especially through my work in biomechanical research and my involvement with Team Policumbent,
where I combined my passion for cycling with technical development in human motion analysis.
Beyond academics, I am a deeply curious and passionate individual with a wide range of interests. 
I have practiced judo for many years, reaching national and international competition levels and earning a first-degree black belt. This sport has shaped my discipline, perseverance, and respect for teamwork.
I also have a profound love for nature and outdoor activities, particularly mountaineering and hiking, which help me disconnect and recharge. 
My passion for cycling is what led me to join Team Policumbent, where I’ve contributed to research and technical development in biomechanics applied to athletes.
In my free time, I love cooking, especially baking traditional leavened products like bread, pizza, and panettone. I’m also fond of Croatian cuisine, thanks to my grandmother, who was born in Rijeka (Fiume) and passed on her love for her culinary roots.
I'm a highly motivated and open-minded person—I actively seek out feedback when I have doubts and thrive in collaborative environments, where I feel intellectually stimulated and driven to give my best. 
I always strive to contribute to my team rather than be a burden, pushing myself to grow and help others do the same.
Finally, I have a deep affection for animals, influenced by my mother, who is a veterinarian. This upbringing has instilled in me a strong sense of empathy and care for living beings.
